# (LANGUAGE) translation following CONTRIBUTING.md

## Describe the solution you'd like

Following the translation section of `CONTRIBUTING.md`, provide the following translation files.

- [ ] `README.md` -> `.github/lang/README.(your iso code).md`
- [ ] `CONTRIBUTING.md` -> `.github/lang/CONTRIBUTING.(your iso code).md`
- [ ] `lang/en.js` -> `lang/(your iso code).js`
- [ ] `content/en/index.md` -> `content/(your iso code)/index.md`
- [ ] `content/en/details.md` -> `content/(your iso code)/details.md`

You can edit `i18n.config.js` to add the new locale, to test it on the site.
